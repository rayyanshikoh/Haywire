**Haywire** is a Windows utility that lets you control AWS GameLift routing by blocking or allowing specific AWS regions using Windows Firewall rules.

It gives you control over matchmaking regions for games that use AWS infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 Select AWS regions to block
- ⚙️ Live AWS IP range fetching
- 🧠 PySide6 GUI
- 📊 Built-in log console
- 🔐 Automatic admin elevation (UAC prompt)
- 📦 Easy PyInstaller packaging

---

## ⚠️ Important Warning

Do NOT block `us-east-1 (N. Virginia)` unless you understand the consequences.

This region is heavily used for AWS routing and matchmaking. Blocking it may cause:

- Failed matchmaking
- Long queue times
- Connection issues

---

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. Fetches AWS IP ranges from official AWS JSON feed  
2. Filters them by selected regions  
3. Writes IPs to a temporary file  
4. Applies Windows Firewall outbound block rules  
5. Removes/replaces rules when updated
